      <p>A direct descendent of the revered Egyptian god Bast,Grimmrr has a face the color of shadows in night water,</p>
      <p>so dark that even in the sunlight streaming through the window he looks more like a cut-out, a place where a cat should be.</p>
      <p>Only his purring gave away his warm presence. </p>
